**What is OgreBattle64:**
It's a game for the Nintendo 64 Console that came out in 2000, 
and is also avalible on the Nintendo Wii Virtual Console 2010.

**What does this code do:**
This Web Tool is an attempt to calculate everything possible about a character based on their class development, which items they have equiped, and how they were obtained (all of which influence a characters stats/ modifiers). 

**Language:**
This tool is written in JavaScript/HTML/CSS with no backend database (data tables all stored in JSON)
Which means after the webpage loads it can work while offline.
And also means it can be hosted on Google Drive: http://goo.gl/M0iq8O

**Questions:**
Feel free to contact me if you have any questions.

**Contribute:**
If you would like to help me improve the tool, I could use help styling the css (without breaking the layout) or also help me get more data points on what the  hit/miss/crit/partial hit formula is that would be awesome!
